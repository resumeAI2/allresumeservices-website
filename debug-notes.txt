Testimonial Section Issue Analysis:

From screenshot: The testimonial section shows:
- Quote icon is visible (dark gray)
- Text is barely visible - appears to be light gray/white text on a light gray background
- Shows "PM" initials and partial text like "I had bee..." and "made my resu..."
- Background appears to be light gray/white, NOT the navy (#1e3a5f) that's in the code

The code has inline styles:
- style={{ backgroundColor: '#1e3a5f' }} on the section
- style={{ color: '#ffffff' }} on the blockquote
- style={{ color: '#d4a853' }} on the Quote icon

But the screenshot shows the background is NOT navy - it's light gray/white.
This suggests the inline styles are being overridden by something.

Possible causes:
1. CSS specificity issue - Tailwind classes overriding inline styles
2. Some parent element has a white/light background that's covering this
3. The section might be getting different styles applied

Solution: Use !important or more specific targeting, or use Tailwind classes with arbitrary values.
